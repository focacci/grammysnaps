# ✅ Infrastructure Updates Complete

I've successfully made all the requested changes to configure your **dev environment** for beta testing:

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. **Moved Terraform Code**

- ✅ Moved all Terraform files from `terraform/` to `aws-infrastructure/`
- ✅ Updated all scripts and documentation to reference the new location

### 2. **Updated Environment Configuration**

- ✅ **Environment**: Changed from `production` to `dev`
- ✅ **Region**: Changed from `us-east-1` to `us-east-2`
- ✅ **S3 Bucket**: Now named `grammysnaps` (simplified naming)

### 3. **Updated Infrastructure Resources**

- ✅ **Terraform State Bucket**: `grammysnaps-terraform-state-dev`
- ✅ **DynamoDB Lock Table**: `grammysnaps-terraform-locks-dev`
- ✅ **Images S3 Bucket**: `grammysnaps`
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: Updated to deploy to `us-east-2`

### 4. **Updated Documentation**

- ✅ `aws-infrastructure/README.md` - Updated paths and instructions
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Updated for new directory structure
- ✅ `AWS_SETUP.md` - Updated configuration details
- ✅ `scripts/setup-infrastructure.sh` - Updated for new paths and dev environment

### 5. **Created Production Planning**

- ✅ `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` - Guide for future production deployment to `us-east-1`

## 📂 New Directory Structure

```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Dev Deployment

1. **Configure AWS credentials for us-east-2**:

   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Set region to us-east-2
   ```

2. **Set up your dev environment secrets**:

   ```bash
   cp aws-infrastructure/terraform.tfvars.example aws-infrastructure/terraform.tfvars
   # Edit and set: jwt_secret, aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key
   ```

3. **Deploy dev infrastructure**:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-infrastructure.sh
   cd aws-infrastructure
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Set up GitHub Actions**:

   - Get the GitHub Actions role ARN from Terraform output
   - Add `AWS_ROLE_ARN` secret to your GitHub repository

5. **Deploy application**:
   - Push to main branch to trigger deployment

## 🌍 Environment Strategy

- **Dev Environment** (current): `us-east-2`, domain: `grannysnaps.dev`

  - Used for beta testing and development
  - Smaller instance sizes for cost optimization
  - Can be scaled down when not in use

- **Production Environment** (future): `us-east-1`, domain: `grannysnaps.dev`
  - Deployed after successful beta testing
  - Multi-AZ setup for high availability
  - Enhanced monitoring and alerting
  - See `PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` for deployment guide

## 💰 Dev Environment Cost Optimization

The dev environment is configured with:

- `db.t3.micro` RDS instance (free tier eligible)
- Minimal ECS CPU/memory allocations
- 7-day backup retention (vs 30 days for production)
- Single-AZ deployment
- Estimated cost: ~$40-60/month

## 🔄 Future Production Migration

When ready to deploy production:

1. Dev environment continues running for testing
2. Production deployed to `us-east-1` with larger resources
3. DNS switched from dev to production
4. Dev environment can be scaled down but retained for testing

Your infrastructure is now ready for **dev environment deployment in us-east-2**! 🎉
